# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project segments customers from the Mall Customers dataset based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** to uncover patterns and provide actionable business insights. It includes:

- **Data exploration and visualization**
- **Feature scaling and preprocessing**
- **Optimal cluster determination** (Elbow and Silhouette methods)
- **K-Means clustering and visualization**
- **Cluster profiling and average spending analysis**

## Live Demo / Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook `CustomerSegmentation.ipynb` contains the full code and visualizations for the analysis.

## Project Report

A detailed report named `CustomerSegmentation_Report.docx` is included in this repository. It covers:

- **Dataset overview and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature scaling and cluster determination**
- **K-Means clustering, cluster profiling, and insights**
- **Visualizations and interpretation of results**

## Tech Stack

- **Analysis & Modeling:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
