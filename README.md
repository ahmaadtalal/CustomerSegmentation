# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project segments customers from the Mall Customers dataset based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** to uncover patterns and provide actionable business insights. It includes:

- **Data exploration and visualization**
- **Feature scaling and preprocessing**
- **Optimal cluster determination** (Elbow and Silhouette methods)
- **K-Means clustering and visualization**
- **Cluster profiling and average spending analysis**

## Live Demo / Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook `CustomerSegmentation.ipynb` contains the full code and visualizations for the analysis.

## Project Report

A detailed report named `CustomerSegmentation_Report.docx` is included in this repository. It covers:

- **Dataset overview and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature scaling and cluster determination**
- **K-Means clustering, cluster profiling, and insights**
- **Visualizations and interpretation of results**

## Tools & Libraries

This project was implemented in **Python** using:

- **Pandas** for data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Scikit-learn** for feature scaling and K-Means clustering  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations  

## Covered Topics

- Customer segmentation using **unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering)**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with histograms, scatterplots, and bar plots  
- **Feature scaling** to standardize income and spending score for clustering  
- Determination of the **optimal number of clusters** using Elbow and Silhouette methods  
- **Cluster profiling**, including demographic analysis and **average spending per cluster**  
- Interpretation of results for **marketing and business insights**

## Tech Stack

- **Analysis & Modeling:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
